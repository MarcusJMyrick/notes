# Notes

This folder contains various notes that I have taken for different purposes, such as for learning, brainstorming, or keeping track of my progress on a project. The notes are organized into subfolders based on the month or year depending on how far the notes go.

## Subfolders
Each subfolder is named according to the month it contains notes for, in the format of the month (e.g. January, Febuary, March etc.). Within each month subfolder, there may be additional subfolders for different topics or projects but typical each file is by date.

## Usage
These notes are intended for personal use, but I have made them public on GitHub in case they might be helpful to someone else. Feel free to browse the notes, but please do not copy or distribute them without permission.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions about these notes, feel free to create an issue on GitHub or contact me directly. I am always happy to learn from others and improve my notes.
