# Elevator Pitch Notes

An elevator pitch is a short, persuasive speech that is used to introduce an idea, product, or service. It's called an elevator pitch because it's supposed to be short enough to give during an elevator ride.

## Purpose

The purpose of an elevator pitch is to quickly grab the listener's attention, explain the value of the idea, product, or service, and make a call to action.

An elevator pitch should be no more than 30 seconds long and have a clear structure that includes:

1. **Introduction**: Start with a greeting and a brief introduction of yourself and your background.
2. **Problem**: Describe the problem that your idea, product, or service solves.
3. **Solution**: Explain how your idea, product, or service solves the problem.
4. **Value Proposition**: Communicate the unique value of your idea, product, or service and why it's better than other alternatives.
5. **Call to Action**: End with a clear call to action that encourages the listener to take action.
