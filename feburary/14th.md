# First time note

if I want to keep track of notes and post them online then github supports all of these actions very easily.


this is how you use code snippets and can also do the same in piazza
``` ruby
def hello
  puts "hello world"
end
```
 this is how you remove hyphens and space from string while keep it an array 

``` ruby
string.split(/\s*-\s*|\s+/).reject(&:empty?)
```

my completed the Acronym ruby practice today 

``` ruby
class Acronym
  def self.abbreviate(string)
    word_array = string.split(/\s*-\s*|\s+/).reject(&:empty?)
    i = 0
    acronym = ""
    while i < word_array.length do
      word = word_array[i]
      acronym += word[0].upcase
      i += 1
    end
    return acronym
  end
end
```
