# First time note

if I want to keep track of notes and post them online then github supports all of these actions very easily.


this is how you use code snippets and can also do the same in piazza
``` ruby
def hello
  puts "hello world"
end
```
 this is how you remove hyphens and space from string while keep it an array 

``` ruby
string.split(/\s*-\s*|\s+/).reject(&:empty?)
```

my completed the Acronym ruby practice today 

``` ruby
class Acronym
  def self.abbreviate(string)
    word_array = string.split(/\s*-\s*|\s+/).reject(&:empty?)
    i = 0
    acronym = ""
    while i < word_array.length do
      word = word_array[i]
      acronym += word[0].upcase
      i += 1
    end
    return acronym
  end
end
```

To create a new line in markdown, use double space at the end of the line.

To highlight a block of code or text, use triple backticks before and after the block or text.

You can add comments in your code using the # symbol.

To access the first character of a string in Ruby, use the index 0.

To iterate over an array in Ruby, use the .each method.


## to test if true or false
To test if something is false one time and then the whole thing is false for the rest of the function, you can use a flag variable to keep track of whether the condition has been false at least once.

```ruby
def check_array(array)
  flag = true
  for element in array do
    if !element
      flag = false
    end
    if flag == false
      break
    end
  end
  return flag
end
```
